### Pandas dataframe inspection, filtering, balancing

The main goal of this package is to make your life easier if you want to:

- Inspect a dataset and compute metrics about its columns content (auto type inference: numeric, mono-label or multi-label).
- Filter the dataset one some criteria (minimum label occurrence, empty example).
- Balance the dataset (TODO) in order to get better performance while training ML or NN models.

### Requirements

- Python 2.7
- Numpy and Pandas

### Do some tests

Just clone this repository, and execute:

    python -m tests.main
    
This will execute a test sample, for you to get what's going on.
